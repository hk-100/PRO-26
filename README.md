**Paneer Chilli-recipe**

One of the favorite dishes from Indian Chinese cuisine is Chilli Paneer which is a vegetarian version of Chilli Chicken.
<sub>And it's one of my favourite</sub>
In a typical Chilli Paneer recipe, the fried paneer cubes are tossed in a sweet, sour, spicy sauce. The paneer cubes can be coated with flours or batter coated and deep fried.
This semi-dry chilli paneer recipe gives a truly restaurant style taste and flavor.
